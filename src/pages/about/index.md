### Using templates

I am so over using WordPress. It has become far too complicated for me to set up a simple blog site using that software and i have found that with my business site, it is extremely slow to load. So i am using a cool new service called Netlify that lets me create a fast loading blog with a simple interface that isnt crowded out by all of the suggested plugins and addons that WordPress requires, and with a simple interface for writing content. But, the down side is that it does require some coding skills that i do not have as yet, so while i am learning, there will be headings and footers and menu options that relate to the template and not my site. Bear with me and just read the blog content if you do happen to stumble across this as i am building.

### Should we connect on social media?

I will take up this issue in a blog post, but i am a bit conflicted about using social media. I know if i am serious about sharing my work with an audience, i do need to be on social media, but at the moment i don't want to be beholden to any of the Facebook channels. I will be testing a few alternative ways to share my content and build my audience, so any feedback on where to find you and how to interact with you would be really great.
